# Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor


In the intricate world of finance, the ability to accurately forecast the price of gold holds immense significance for investors, financial institutions, and policymakers. This project embarks on the journey of constructing a robust machine learning (ML) algorithm tasked with predicting gold prices based on a curated selection of financial indicators, namely the S&P 500 (SPX), Silver (SLV), United States Oil (USO), and the EUR/USD exchange rate.

<br />
The Algorithm used fo this ML model is Random Forest Regressor and it has an accuracy of about 99%.
